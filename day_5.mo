Challenge 1 : Write a function is_anonymous that takes no arguments but returns true is

add_favorite_number that takes n of type Nat and stores this value in the 
HashMap where the key is the principal of the caller. This function has 
no return value.
show_favorite_number that takes no argument and returns n of type ?Nat, 
n is the favorite number of the person as defined in the previous function

the caller has already registered his favorite number, 
the value in memory isn't modified. 
This function will return a text of type Text that indicates 
"You've already registered your number" in that case and
"You've successfully registered your number" in the other scenario.*/

/*Challenge 5 : Write two functions

update_favorite_number
delete_favorite_number
Challenge 6 : Write a function deposit_cycles that allow anyone to deposit cycles into the canister. This function takes no parameter but returns n of type Nat corresponding to the amount of cycles deposited by the call.

Challenge 7 (hard ??????) : Write a function withdraw_cycles that takes a parameter n of type Nat corresponding to the number of cycles you want to withdraw from the canister and send it to caller asumming the caller has a callback called deposit_cycles()
Note : You need two canisters. 
Note 2 : Don't do that in production without admin protection or your might be the target of a cycle draining attack.

Challenge 8 : Rewrite the counter (of day 1) but this time the counter will be kept accross ugprades. Also declare a variable of type Nat called versionNumber that will keep track of how many times your canister has been upgraded.

Challenge 9 : In a new file, copy and paste the functionnalities you've created in challenges 2 to 5. This time the hashmap and all records should be preserved accross upgrades.

Challenge 10 (optional) : In autonomy, write a CRUD canister, you can add as much functionnalities as you want, a few examples :

Anonymous principal rejection.
Cycle functionnality for registration.
Admin management.
Note : Only practice challenge 10 if you wish to, this is optional and it will not be taken into account for any ranking.
